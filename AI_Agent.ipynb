The volume of a cube is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nV = s^3\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( s \\) is the side length of the cube. We're provided with a volume of 27 cubic units:\n\n\\[\ns^3 = 27\n\\]\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the side length of the larger cube is \\( s = 3 \\) units.\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area of the larger cube. The formula for the surface area \\( A \\) of a cube is:\n\n\\[\nA = 6s^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in our value for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\nA = 6 \\cdot (3^2) = 6 \\cdot 9 = 54 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to consider the situation where we remove smaller cubes (1x1x1 cubes) from this larger cube. We want to minimize the surface area of the remaining structure after removing some of these smaller cubes.\n\nWhen a smaller cube is removed from the interior of the larger cube, the surface area of the cube increases due to the newly exposed faces of the removed cube. Each removed cube exposes 5 new square units of surface area (the cube has 6 faces, and removing it exposes 5 faces of that cube):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface area change when removing 1 small cube} = +5\n\\]\n\nLet's analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Removing a small cube from the interior**: If we remove a cube from the interior (not from the outer surface), we lose 1 square unit of surface area from the outer surface area (the face where the cube was originally), but we add 5 square units (exposed faces of the removed cube). Hence, the net addition to the surface area is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta A = 5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\n2. **Effect of removing surface cubes**: If we remove a cube that is on the surface of the larger cube, we lose 1 square unit from the outer surface area and gain 5 square units, similar to the above cases. However, this situation still means that, overall, the removal of each cube still results in a net increase in surface area.\n\nThus, from the analysis, if we remove just one cube, the surface area increases. Consequently, if we were to remove all 27 small cubes, the original surface area would grow significantly, thereby confirming that mass removal from the interior adds exposed area overall.\n\n3. **Minimizing Surface Area**: To minimize the surface area, we should not remove any cubes. If any cubes are taken away, they will always result in greater or equal surface area due to the net increase whenever a cube is removed.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Thus, the minimal surface area of this larger structure is maintained by not removing any of the smaller cubes.\n\nTherefore, to minimize the surface area of the remaining structure, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\] \n\nThis means we do not need to remove any smaller cubes at all to minimize the surface area of the cube."
